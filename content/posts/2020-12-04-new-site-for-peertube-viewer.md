In addition to the docs, which can still be found at [docs.peertube-viewer.sgued.fr](https://docs.peertube-viewer.sgued.fr), peertube-viewer now has a new website.

This website will host the releases binaries and news about peertube-viewer. An rss feed is available [here](/posts/index.xml).

Here are a few useful links within the site:

- [Homepage](/)
- [RSS feed](/posts/index.xml)
- [Download page](/download)
- [Releases page](/releases)

The site itself is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and is on a [public gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-website).
The theme is a heavily trimmed down version of [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo), with all JS removed, and a lot of updates on the look.

Don't hesitate to improve it by making a Merge Request to [the repo of the website](https://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-websithttps://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-website)
