In addition to the docs, which can still be found at [docs.peertube-viewer.com](https://docs.peertube-viewer.com), peertube-viewer now has a new website.

This website will host the releases binaries and news about peertube-viewer. An rss feed is available [here]("/posts/index.xml").

The site itself is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and is on a [public gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-website).
The theme is a heavily trimmed down version of [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo), with all JS removed, and a lot of updates on the look.

Don't hesitate to improve it by making a Merge Request to [the repo of the website](https://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-websithttps://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-website)
