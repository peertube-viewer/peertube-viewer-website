**peertube-viewer-rs** is a small utility to enable you to browse videos available on any [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org) instances, without having to launch a web browser.
It is heavily inspired by [youtube-viewer](https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer).

It was first [written is c++](https://gitlab.com/SostheneGuedon/peertube-viewer) as a small project to learn, but as since been rewritten in rust, under the name [peertube-viewer-rs](https://gitlab.com/peertube-viewer/peertube-viewer-rs).
